# Digit Recognition System
## Description:
This simple digit recognition system is an APP for detecting the hardwritten digits in the screen. It uses a convolution neural network. It allows users to write in colors besides black. Besides, It is a convenient and easily accessible app, with a good-looking GUI built using tkinter with thorough tools, by which we can save the valuable result for subsequent analysis differnet AI model. However, the RNN model currently used does not have very high accurary for hardwritten digits detection (esp, the number '1').

Note: This project has the topic of objected-oriented programing, AI and GUI.
