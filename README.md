# Digit Recognition System

## Description

This simple digit recognition system is an APP for detecting the hardwritten digits in the screen. It uses a convolution neural network. It allows users to write in various colors besides black. Besides, It is a convenient and easily accessible app, with a good-looking GUI built using tkinter with thorough tools, by which we can save the valuable result for subsequent analysis of differnet AI model. However, the RNN model currently used does not have very high accuracy for hardwritten digits recognition (esp, the number '1').

Note: The topics of this project are object-oriented programming, AI/ML and GUI.

## Usage


## Thanks

* Many, many thanks to Anastasias Georgious from Johns Hopkins University for guilding this project.
* Thanks to everyone who works on all the awesome Python machine learning and GUI libraries like tensorflow, cv2, tkinter, keras, etc, etc that makes this kind of stuff so easy and fun in Python.
